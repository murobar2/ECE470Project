ECE 470 - Introduction to Robotics Final Project

Hello! Welcome to our README. This will include an in-depth and intuitive summary of our codebase.  
For now, it's a work in progress!  
Make sure to come back next update for a more detailed experience where we will get a chance to wow you with our big brains and introductory knowledge of robotics.  


# Rover main script
Script Name: Threaded child script: Robotnik  
Description: The main drive script for the base of the rover that controls the "random drive" and the function for the rover to approach a sample when it has been identified.  

The main rover script has two functions currently: wait and sysCall_threadmain.  

The wait function is a simple function that creates a "wait" feature similar to that of python or most other scripting languages in Lua which doesn't currently have a native wait function.  

The sysCall_threadmain function dictates the rover motion. It first initializes, then writes the four wheels to each of the motors. 
Then it performs a check to see if the blobs are detected. If blobs were detected, it stops moving, then waits half a second before moving to approach the sample that was detected. If no blobs were detected, it begins its pattern of "random motion" turning and moving to find a new sample.  

# Camera Views and Blob Detection
Our robot is simulated to have 2 camera feeds for operator review and one blob detector specific camera.
Script Name: blob_camera customization script

Script Nmae: blob_camera child script



Till next time.
